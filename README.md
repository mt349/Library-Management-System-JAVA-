# 📚 Library Management System (Java)

A **console-based Library Management System** built in **Java**, designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand **OOP concepts, collections, file handling, and persistent data storage**.

This application allows users to manage books in a library and **stores data permanently using file handling**, so information is not lost when the program exits.
